## Singly Linked List in C++
This is a C++ implementation of a singly linked list, which allows insertion of nodes at specified positions and printing of the list.

### Usage
To use this code, simply compile and run the main.cpp file in a C++ compiler. The code currently inserts four nodes with data values 1, 3, 5, and 7, and then prints out the list.

You can modify the insert() function to insert nodes with different data values and at different positions in the list. For example, to insert a node with data value 2 at the second position in the list, you could call insert(2, 2).

You can also modify the print() function to change how the list is displayed. For example, you could add a message before the list to indicate what it represents, or you could change the delimiter between the data values.
